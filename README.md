This is a template for typesetting theses at the University of Southampton.

Originally provided by Electronics & Computer Science at the University of Southampton, it was extensively modified by a number of postgraduates in Geography & Environment at the University of Southampton through the years. These folks include Chris Hackney, followed by Tom Bishop and Robin Wilson. Gerard Capes and Tom Bishop produced this version of the template in 2016.
